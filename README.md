# ✅ PCAP Parser for PTP/gPTP Analysis (C) 

A lightweight, high-performance C-based parser for analyzing `.pcap` files with a focus on **Precision Time Protocol (PTP)** and **generalized PTP (gPTP)** frames.  

Designed for time synchronization validation, clock comparison, and cycle integrity checks between networked devices.

---
### ❔ Problem Statement ❔
Analyzing PTP/gPTP synchronization across networked devices presents significant challenges when using standard packet capture tools like Wireshark. Key issues include:

- Difficulty in tracking complete sync cycles between specific device pairs
- Complex manual effort required to verify protocol compliance
- No straightforward way to calculate clock offsets between master/slave devices
- Limited visibility into timing accuracy and sync failures
- Time-consuming analysis of large packet captures

This project aims to simplify PTP/gPTP analysis by providing a dedicated CLI tool that automatically validates timing synchronization, verifies protocol adherence, and calculates clock offsets between specified devices.

### 💡 Project Overview

This tool reads `.pcap` files directly (no dependencies on `libpcap`), decodes Ethernet and IP headers, identifies PTP/gPTP packets, and extracts synchronization-related information such as:

- Master/slave clock identity
- Sync, Follow_Up, Delay_Req, and Delay_Resp sequence verification
- Complete gPTP cycle validation between specific IP/MAC pairs
- Timing offsets and cycle timing accuracy

  - [❌] Total PTP packets
  - [❌] Completed cycles
  - [❌] Missing sequence IDs
- [❌] Export data as CSV or JSON for post-analysis
- [❌] Optional: CLI filters
  ```bash
  ./pcap_parser test.pcap --filter gptp --summary
  ./pcap_parser test.pcap --verify-cycle --src 192.168.0.10 --dst 192.168.0.20
---
### **Phase 6️⃣: Performance Optimization**
- [❌] Refactor to a multi-threaded producer-consumer model
- [❌] Implement a single producer thread for reading the PCAP file
- [❌] Implement a pool of consumer threads for parallel packet processing
- [❌] Create a thread-safe work queue for communication
- [❌] Update Makefile to link with pthread library
